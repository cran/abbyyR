#' @param taskId id of the task; required
#' @return Data frame with all the details of the task you are trying to delete: id (task id), registrationTime, statusChangeTime, status (Submitted, Queued, InProgress, Completed, ProcessingFailed, Deleted, NotEnoughCredits), filesCount (No. of files), credits, resultUrl (URL for the processed file if applicable)
